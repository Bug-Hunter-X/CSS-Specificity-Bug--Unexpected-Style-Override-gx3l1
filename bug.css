The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors. The intention is to style elements with the class "my-class" within a div with the id "my-div", but the styling is not applied as expected.

```css
#my-div {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#my-div .my-class {
  background-color: lightcoral;
}

.my-class {
  background-color: lightgreen; /* This rule unintentionally overrides the more specific rule */
}
```

The unexpected behavior arises because the last rule `.my-class` has higher specificity due to its simplicity, thus overriding the more specific `#my-div .my-class`.
